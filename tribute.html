             aerospace engineer, and the 11th President of India (2002–2007). Born on 15 October 1931 in Rameswaram,

    He played a key role in India’s space and missile programs, including the development of SLV-III, Agni, 
    and Prithvi missiles, as well as the Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998. A visionary, 
    he worked tirelessly for India’s technological advancement and dreamed of making India a developed nation by 2020.
    Dr. Kalam authored several books like Wings of Fire and Ignited Minds that continue to inspire millions.
    Awarded the Bharat Ratna in 1997, he was loved as the “People’s President” for his humility and connection with the youth.
    He passed away on 27 July 2015 while addressing students, leaving behind a legacy of knowledge, vision, and inspiration</h5>
